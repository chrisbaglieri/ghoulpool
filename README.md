In The Beginning

A long time ago a bunch of friends thought it would be entertaining to follow in the steps of Howard Stern and assemble a death pool. Sick yes, tasteless absolutely, but generally harmeless. Over the years, the complexity and scope of this ridiculous idea became a chore.

From Chore To Idea
------------------

I'm a lazy programmer. I strive to minimize the time spent on all tasks; effort spent must be for maximum gain. I'm willing to go to great lengths to accomplish this goal. Ghoul Pool is a product of that laziness.
